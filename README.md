Showcharms Client
========================================================================
  
Running the client
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the root of the main folder there is a file called "Showcharms.html"
Open this in your web browser and voila, you're playing through our client




Limitations
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Registering a new name is not possible from our client**

**Changing names is not possible within our client**

You have to already be logged in via cookies from play.pokemonshowdown.com, and you'll be prompted each time you log in via the rogue server to do a simple copy/paste from your screen. 

Alternatively you can just use an unregistered name every time.

The only reason the html client works is by telling showdown 'HEY THIS IS YOUR TEST CLIENT' and there's a clunky method one has to go through for logging in. If we didn't set it to test client = true, showdown refuses the connection and you can't log in at all since the client has been modified.
